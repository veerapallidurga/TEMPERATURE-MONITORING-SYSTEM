# ENTER DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED NOT LESS THAN 500 WORDS
A Temperature Monitoring System is used to monitor and control the temperature of a given environment. It can be used in various applications, such as industrial automation, weather stations, smart homes, and more. The system typically uses a temperature sensor (like LM35 or DHT11) to detect the temperature and display it on a user interface, with the possibility of triggering alerts or actions when certain thresholds are crossed.

Here is an abstract code to implement a basic temperature monitoring system using an LM35 sensor and a microcontroller like an Arduino, which can be displayed on a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using Python (with Tkinter for the GUI part).
